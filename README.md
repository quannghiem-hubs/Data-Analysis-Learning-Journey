# Unemployment Prediction in Canada
## Overview
This project explores unemployment trends across Canada and leverages predictive modeling to analyze key patterns in labor force characteristics. The goal is to provide actionable insights into factors influencing employment rates. 
## Dataset
The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset containing labor force characteristics, including unemployment and employment rates, gender, and regional data across Canadian provinces from 2020 to 2024. 
### Key Features:
- **Source**: Statistics Canada
- **Timeframe**: 2020-2024
- **Attribute**:
  - Labour Force Characteristics: Unemployment, Employment, and Participation rates.
  - Demographics: Gender
  - Regions: Canada and individual provinces
## Tool & Methodologies
1. **Libraries Used**:
   - pandas for data manipulation
   - numpy for numerical computations
   - matplotlib for data visualization
   - scikit-learn for machine learning
2. **Methods**:
   - Data Cleaning: Handled missing  values and standardized formats.
   - Linear Regression: Modeled unemployment rates using relevant predictors.
   - Performance Metrics: Evaluated models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) AND r-SQUARED.
## Result 
- **Trend identifies**:
  - The unemployment rate showed significant changes between 2020 and 2024 from 10% to just 6.7%.
  - Regional variations highlighted unique challenges in different provinces.
- **Model Performance**:
  - The predictive model achieved satisfactory accuracy, with insights into factors contributing to unemployment trends.
## Future Work
- Incorporating additional features such as industry-specific employment data.
- Exploring advanced modeling techniques like time-series forecasting for better predictions.
- Analyzing the impact of external factors like policy changes on unemployment trends.
## Conclusion
This project provides a foundational analysis of unemployment trends in Canada, offering valuable insights for policymakers and researchers. With further enhancements, it can serve as a robust tool for labor market analysis.
